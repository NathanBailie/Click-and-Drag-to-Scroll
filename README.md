# Click and Drag to Scroll

## Description
An idea for this project I have found from a 30 day [challenge](https://javascript30.com/) where you complete 1 project each day in vanilla JavaScript. This is a slider with an interesting visual effect. I improved on the original idea by adding the addition of adding a random color to each slider card.
